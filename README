I'm new to my current company as a SysAdmin and recently there was a discussion that HR doesn't have the proper permissions to add new employee information into our system 
(which I thought was somewhat strange, but oh well). They usually pop and email over to me and my two coworkers to add the employee into our system. 
I had some extra time so I thought, "I'm going to see if I can script this".

Basically the script populates a form that asks for the employee ID, first name, last name, labor class, time type and shop. 
After that is all entered, it populates a separate form where the HR user can add the necessary roles for the new employee (timecard, employee type, etc.)

All the data gets added to our SQL database which houses all of the employee information as well as some other things. 
Once that has been added, if the user were to look in the actual system for the employee they would see all of their information properly set up. 

This requires the SqlServer module to be installed for the script to function.

The script posted is the 'core' idea. Feel free to take it and modify it to your needs. Be creative!
